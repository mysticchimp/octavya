 Profitability and Financial Stability
Net Income: Indicates whether the company is profitable. A consistent or growing net income suggests financial stability and long-term viability12.

Operating Profit Margin: Reflects how efficiently the company manages its costs relative to revenue. A high margin indicates effective management and operational efficiency1.

Revenue Trends: Reviewing the income statement for revenue growth over time helps determine if the company is expanding or facing challenges23.

2. Liquidity and Debt Levels
Balance Sheet: Shows the company's assets, liabilities, and equity. A strong asset-to-liability ratio indicates good financial health and the ability to meet obligations34.

Current Ratio: Measures liquidity by comparing current assets to current liabilities. A ratio above 1 suggests the company can cover short-term debts without financial strain4.

3. Cash Flow
Cash Flow Statement: Tracks how cash moves in and out of the company through operating, investing, and financing activities. Positive cash flow from operations signals that the business generates enough cash to sustain itself34.

4. Investment in Growth
Capital Expenditures: Indicates whether the company is reinvesting in its growth through infrastructure, technology, or other assets1.

Retained Earnings: Shows how much profit is reinvested into the business rather than paid out as dividends, signaling a focus on long-term growth13.

5. Industry Competitiveness
Comparing financial metrics like revenue growth, profit margins, and debt levels with industry averages can reveal whether the company is competitive in its sector47.

6. Management Insights
Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A): Found in annual reports, this section provides qualitative insights into how leadership views the company's performance and future strategy. It can also highlight potential risks or challenges26.
